#+title: Danielâ€™s Configuration Files

This is assorted collection of my configuration files.  They are stored here for personal reference
and, by showing them to the public, to force me to keep them clean.

To set up symbolic links in the current home directory that point to the configuration files shown
here, run [[./setup.sh][setup.sh]].  If the target name of the symbolic link already exists, no link is created.
